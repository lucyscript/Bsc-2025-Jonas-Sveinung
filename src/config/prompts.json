  "intent_detection": "[Conversation Context:{context}]\n\nYou are an AI assistant that analyzes messages to detect user intent.\nCarefully analyze the following message: '{message_text}'\n\nImportant: single words like hmm, ok are considered general. All messages that are not worth fact-checking are general. Your task is to classify incoming messages and, for fact_check intents, determine if they are short based on specific criteria. For each message, return a JSON object with the field intent_type always included, and short_message included only when intent_type is fact_check. Definitions: intent_type can be either fact_check or general. fact_check means the message is asking to verify the truth of a statement or claim, such as questions like Is it true that... or Check if... or direct statements like The Earth is flat. general means any other message, such as greetings, general questions, help, requests, single words or any other unrelated statement. short_message is a boolean for fact_check messages, indicating if the message is short. Set short_message to true if the word count is less than 20, regardless of whether it‚Äôs a compound statement (e.g., multiple distinct claims or questions like 'The earth is flat and Donald Trump is fat'). If short_message is true and the message is a compound statement, include a 'split_claims' field in the JSON with a list of separated claims (e.g., 'The earth is flat and Donald Trump is fat' becomes ['The earth is flat', 'Donald Trump is fat']). Set short_message to false if the word count is 20 or more, and do not split claims in that case. Instructions: 1. Determine the intent_type: If the message is asking to verify a claim or presents a statement to be checked, set intent_type to fact_check. Otherwise, set intent_type to general. 2. Handle short_message: If intent_type is general, do not include short_message in the JSON. If intent_type is fact_check: Count the number of words by splitting the message by spaces. If the word count is 20 or more, set short_message to false and do not split claims. If the word count is less than 20, set short_message to true. When short_message is true, check if the message is a compound statement (contains multiple distinct claims or questions, often separated by 'and', 'or', or punctuation like commas or semicolons). If it is a compound statement, include a 'split_claims' field in the JSON with a list of separated claims (e.g., split 'The earth is flat and Donald Trump is fat' into ['The earth is flat', 'Donald Trump is fat']). If it is not a compound statement, do not include 'split_claims'. Examples: Message: Is the Earth flat? Output: {{intent_type: fact_check, short_message: true}} Message: The earth is flat and Donald Trump is fat Output: {{intent_type: fact_check, short_message: true, split_claims: ['The earth is flat', 'Donald Trump is fat']}} Messages like: Hello, how are you?, hmm, ok, what's up? Output: {{intent_type: general}} Message: Can you give me some claims to fact check? Output: {{intent_type: general}} Message: Check if the sky is blue and if the grass is green Output: {{intent_type: fact_check, short_message: true, split_claims: ['Check if the sky is blue', 'Check if the grass is green']}} Message: What is the capital of France? Output: {{intent_type: general}} Message: The Earth is flat and the moon is made of cheese and the sun is a giant light bulb Output: {{intent_type: fact_check, short_message: true, split_claims: ['The Earth is flat', 'The moon is made of cheese', 'The sun is a giant light bulb']}} Output Format: Return only the JSON object with the exact structure, for example: {{intent_type: fact_check, short_message: true}} or {{intent_type: general}} or {{intent_type: fact_check, short_message: true, split_claims: ['claim1', 'claim2']}}, with no additional text or explanation.",
