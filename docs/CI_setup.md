# Setting up CI pipeline

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, including configuring GitHub Actions and integrating a dynamic Gist badge.

---

## There are three CI files in this template repository.

1. `python-package-conda.yaml` this file contains the GitHub action workflow which runs every time someone pushes code to the remote branch.
2. `ci.yaml` this file contains the GitHub action workflow which runs when a pull request is created or updated. With dynamic coverage badge comparing the coverage to the main branch.
3. `merge.yaml` this file contains the GitHub action workflow which runs when a branch is merged to `main`.

### How to Set Up `GIST_SECRET` and `GIST_ID`for GitHub Actions

#### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. **Sign In to GitHub:**
   - Log in to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

2. **Navigate to Developer Settings:**
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.

3. **Generate a New Token:**
   - Click **Generate new token** (classic).
   - **Scopes to Select:**
     - Check the **`gist`** scope to allow access to your gists.

4. **Set Expiration (Optional):**
   - Choose a validity period for the token, or select **No expiration** for an indefinite token.

5. **Generate the Token:**
   - Click **Generate token**.
   - Copy the token displayed on the screen. (You wonâ€™t be able to see it again, so save it securely.)
   - Note down the gist id from the URL which will be in the form of `https://gist.github.com/{user}/{GIST_ID}`


#### Step 2: Add `GIST_SECRET` and `GIST_ID` as secrets to Your Repository

1. **Open Repository Settings:**
   - Navigate to the repository where you want to use the Gist.

2. **Go to Secrets and Variables:**
   - In the repository, click **Settings**.
   - Select **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.

3. **Add a New Secret:**
   - Click **New repository secret**.
   - Set the **Name** as `GIST_SECRET`.
   - Paste the Personal Access Token (PAT) into the **Value** field.

4. **Save the Secret:**
   - Click **Add secret** to save.
  
5. **Repeat steps 1-4 for `GIST_ID`** 


#### Step 3: Add `GIST_OWNER` as an env variable

   1. **Open Repository Settings:**
      - Navigate to the repository where you want to use the Gist.
  
   2. **Create new Environment:**
      - In the repository, click **Settings**.
      - Select **Environments**.
      - Click **New Environment**
      - Give it a name and click **Configure environment**
  
   3. **Add environment variables**
      - Click **Add environment variable**
      - Set the **Name** as `GIST_OWNER`.
      - Set your username or gist owners username as **Value**
      - Click **Add variable**

#### Step 3: Use `GIST_SECRET` in Your Workflow

In your GitHub Actions workflow, reference the `GIST_SECRET` as follows:

```yaml
- name: Create Gist Badge
  uses: schneegans/dynamic-badges-action@v1.7.0
  with:
    auth: ${{ secrets.GIST_SECRET }}
    gistID: ${{ secrets.GIST_ID }}
    filename: badge.json
    label: coverage
    message: 85%
    color: green
```


#### Step 4: Create a GitHub Gist

1. **Sign In:** Log in to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
2. **Navigate to Gists:** Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Your gists" from the dropdown menu.
3. **Create a New Gist:** Click the "New gist" button.
4. **Add Content:**
   - **Description:** Provide a brief description of your gist.
   - **Filename:** Enter a filename, `coverage.REPO_NAME.main.json` (Replace REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub repo name.)
   - **Content:** Paste the sample coverage data `{"schemaVersion":1,"label":"coverage","message":"36%","color":"red"}`
5. **Set Visibility:**
   - **Public Gist:** Visible to everyone and searchable.
   - **Secret Gist:** Not listed publicly but accessible via URL.
6. **Create Gist:** Click "Create public gist" or "Create secret gist" based on your preference.

#### Step 5: Retrieve the Gist ID

After creating the gist, you'll be redirected to its page. The URL will look like this:
`https://gist.github.com/your_username/gist_id`

The `gist_id` is the unique identifier for your gist.

#### Step 6: Integrate the Gist into Your Project


To embed the gist in your project's README or other documentation, use the following syntax:

```
[![Gist Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/${{ env.GIST_OWNER }}/${{ secrets.GIST_ID }}/raw/badge.json)](https://gist.github.com/${{ env.GIST_OWNER }}/${{ secrets.GIST_ID }})
```

#### Step 7: Set the `GIST_ID` in secrets

* Replace the gist id in the CI files under `ci.yaml`, `merge.yaml` etc.
